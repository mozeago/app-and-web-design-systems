### Font size
minimum font for body text to 16sp to 18sp(Roboto) for android and 17pt for iOS.  
fonts with thiner strokes require large font size for body text.  
#### Headline text  
headline to be contrasting but 2-3 lines only.  
for body text use system default font and use another font for headlines/titles.

Use a text input font size of at least 16px.  
Secondary text should be about 2 sizes smaller than your paragaph text. like lesser labels, captions, etc. – use a size a couple notches smaller – such as 13px or 14px. I do NOT recommend going down just one font size, since then it’s too easy to confuse with normal text. In addition, when text is less important, you want to style it so that you’re clearly communicating the lesser importance – often using, say, a lighter shade of gray (something about 70% as strong is a good place to start).  
Always view your designs on an actual device.  
Material Design’s default font size is 16px Roboto and secondary font size is 14px.  
iOS’s default font size is 17px SF Pro and secondary font size is 15px.  
## Desktop Web Typography Guidelines  
#### Text-heavy pages.  
Articles, blogs, news, etc. These are pages where the primary purpose the user has on the page is to read. There is very little in terms of interaction – perhaps just clicking a few links.  
16px – absolute minimum for text-heavy pages
18px – a better font size to start with. You’re not printing out a single-spaced Word document; you’re writing for people sitting a couple feet from their decade-old monitors.
20px+ – may feel awkwardly large at first, but is always worth trying out in your design app. The best-looking text-heavy site on the web, Medium.com, has a default article text size of 21px.
#### Interaction-heavy pages.  
Apps that involve more hovering, clicking, searching for an item in a list or table, editing, typing, etc. There may be plenty of text on the page, but it’s not stuff you read straight through like a book.  
Instead, 14px-16px is the norm.  
##### 1. Header font size.  
This is the biggest font size on your page. Use it for the headline or section titles. If you have both a headline and section titles, you should almost certainly be using two different font sizes here.
##### 2. Default font size.  
This is the most common font size on your page, and should be used for all body text – as well as most controls, like text boxes, dropdowns, buttons, and menus. The key header mistake beginning designers make here is to use many font sizes for elements that should all be one font size.
##### 3. Secondary font size.  
This is a font size – usually about 2pt smaller than your default font size – that you use for less-important details of the site. Supporting information and stats, sometimes captions, etc.  
##### 4. Tertiary/caption/label/wildcard font size

Minimum body text size is 24dp – reserve subtext sizes for non-crucial information. Use medium font weights in a restricted manner – and avoid bold. While the smallest body text size for Android Auto is 24dp, subtext type sizes below 24dp can be used sparingly. Because this subtext size is not easily glanceable, it should be reserved for non-crucial information, such as status bar content.  
Google Sans should be used for type sizes 32dp and larger. Roboto is used everywhere else because it is legible in smaller sizes. When using a display font best suited to large text, such as Google Sans, keep it at type sizes of 32dp or larger. Use Roboto for smaller, secondary text because it maintains good legibility at sizes below 32dp.
