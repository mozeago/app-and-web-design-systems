## App & Web Design Systems
### Font size
minimum font for body text to 16sp to 18sp(Roboto) for android and 17pt for iOS.  
fonts with thiner strokes require large font size for body text.  
#### Headline text  
headline to be contrasting but 2-3 lines only.  
for body text use system default font and use another font for headlines/titles.

Use a text input font size of at least 16px.  
Secondary text should be about 2 sizes smaller than your paragaph text. like lesser labels, captions, etc. – use a size a couple notches smaller – such as 13px or 14px. I do NOT recommend going down just one font size, since then it’s too easy to confuse with normal text. In addition, when text is less important, you want to style it so that you’re clearly communicating the lesser importance – often using, say, a lighter shade of gray (something about 70% as strong is a good place to start).  
Always view your designs on an actual device.  
Material Design’s default font size is 16px Roboto and secondary font size is 14px.  
iOS’s default font size is 17px SF Pro and secondary font size is 15px.  
## Desktop Web Typography Guidelines  
#### Text-heavy pages.  
Articles, blogs, news, etc. These are pages where the primary purpose the user has on the page is to read. There is very little in terms of interaction – perhaps just clicking a few links.  
#### Interaction-heavy pages.  
Apps that involve more hovering, clicking, searching for an item in a list or table, editing, typing, etc. There may be plenty of text on the page, but it’s not stuff you read straight through like a book.
